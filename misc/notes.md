* “Until recently, Sefer Hakavod was believed to be extant only in quotations from it in the works of near contemporaries of Judah’s. But Israeli scholar Joseph Dan says a manuscript at Oxford’s Bodleian Library is almost certainly the full text of Sefer Hasidim. (So strict was Judah about not signing his writing that, says Dan, if one ever found an original manuscript attributed to him by name, “that would itself be proof that is not authentic.”) “
